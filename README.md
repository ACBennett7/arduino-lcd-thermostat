# arduino-lcd-thermostat

This is a very basic program to run a DHT11 Humidity and Temperature sensor into the Arduino Uno and display temperature and heat index on a 16x2 LCD. Other sensor models, Arduino boards, and LCDs could be used, but please verify connectivity and input/output!

I included a serial monitor print statement since I use this connected to my laptop, but if you are soldering the components or using wirelessly you may not need that step (it lets me know if a cable has come loose and there is a bad connection on the sensor).

***I will be including schematics soon, but you can find common instructions by searching for "arduino lcd schematics" and/or "arduino dht11 schematics".

Once again, this is a simple program for a fun little device to have around, feel free to provide feedback and branch away!
